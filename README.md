# surfs_up


## Overview of the analysis:

Explain the purpose of this analysis.
I am planning to open a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu. W. Avy, a potential investor has requested I analyze weather datasets to ensure the surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable. I will be using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to analyze a weather dataset for Oahu. In this challenge, I will specifically analyze the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

#### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. I then converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.

***Summary Statistics for December Temperatures***

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. I then converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.

## Results:

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary:

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
