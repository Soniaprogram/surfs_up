## Overview of the analysis:

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

## Results:

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


## Summary:

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
